Hello, my name is Aashay Deshpande, and I'm currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in artificial intelligence and data science engineering at K.K. Wagh College of Engineering and Research in Nashik, Maharashtra.

I'm an ambitious and self-driven individual. I thrive on challenges and constantly set goals for myself, so I have something to strive towards. Also, I'm a people person. I love meeting new people and learning about their lives and their backgrounds. I can almost always find common ground with strangers.

During my school time, I was selected by the committee members to be a school leader. In 2018, I played football at the state level. I've also awarded a certificate for scoring the highest marks in social science during tenth grade.

I'm looking forward to gaining experience in how things practically work. 
That's why I'm seeking an internship and looking for opportunities to learn from experienced people in the industry.

My areas of interest are IoT, database management systems, software engineering, and data analysis. Recently I've deliveredÂ college-level seminars and project reports.
